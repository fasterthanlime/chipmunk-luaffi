## chipmunk-luaffi

Trying to make ooc + lua + Chipmunk2D play nice.

Chipmunk2D is kinda hard to bind because, yes, it's pure C,
but when using rock to generate luaffi bindings, some structs
are only typedef'd and well there are some holes to plug there,
so this is a reference directory to try and make that work.
